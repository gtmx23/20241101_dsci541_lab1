    "1. The difference between misinformation and disinformation is that misinformation is simply false information, and may not necessarily be targeted or have a negative intention, such as an intent to cause harm. On the other hand, disinformation is often targeted at another group, and is intended to mislead audiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. While disinformation campaigns can take various forms, one general goal is to often cause confusion and tension in the general public, sometimes even a targeted population or community. This is often achieved by creating divisions by amplifying divisive issues, undermining trust by spreading misleading information or by trying to manipulate public opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Online echo chamber refers to a situation in which individuals (or groups) engage in conversations and share perspectives that amplify their personal beliefs, while excluding marginalized or opposing viewpoints. This is often facilitated by social media, whose algorithm is intended to help engage with like-minded individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Deepfakes are artificial media that is created using deep learning techniques, to manipulate or replace existing content. These medias, created by generative models are often so well created that it is almost impossible to distinguish a deepfake from a real media. Due to this reason, deepfakes are very harmful to exist on the free internet. GPTs are a series of language transformer models. Each version of GPT is trained to generate human-like text based on the input it receives.\n",

    "1.Using engagement as the main metric to build an online platforms is not inherently unethical, but could be problematic. \n",
    "The engagement metrics are important for the platform to understand the users' interest so that the platform can improve the users experience, which is good for platform since more consumers coming in and potentially increases the revenue. However, if we only look on engagement without considering the quality of the content can lead to the spread of the explicit content, disinformation or harmful content. Moreover, it could lead to addictive behaviors and mental health issues. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. We do have diverse metrics. Other than engagement, we can use a 5 degree metrics to measure the content quality like user satisfaction or misinformation rates. In addition, instead of looking at the immediate engagement, we can evaluate how the content affects users over time. Moreover, the platform can be more transparent and allow the users to understand why they are seeing certain content. Metrics can also be designed to asses the impact of content on users' mental health. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Data scientist, the company leadership, the governmental branch that regulates these industries, some third party organization, and the consumers should all be responsible for a better use of metrics. Data scientist have a responsibility to develop and propose metrics that are ethically sound. Company Leadership should prioritize responsible metrics that balance business goals with user well-being. Government can play a role in setting standards and guidelines to ensure that online platforms operate responsibly. Third-Party Organizations can audit and compare with baseline of companies to see if model is drifting without biases. Consumers should be informed how engagement metrics influence their experience and content."

    "1. No, it is not alright to do so. Particularly in the current media landscape, where clickbait is rife and consumers are incentivised to scroll quickly past articles and posts which do not immediately stand out to them, the primary purpose of headlines is arguably to grab attention, whatever the cost. As such, producers of online articles are also incentivised to make headlines which invite engagement but might be misleading, and the contents of an article might not always match the headline. Consumers like us thus need to be careful and should read articles in full before sharing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Individual consumers should take responsibility for their part in propagating fake news, as consumers play a critical part in driving engagement. Their behaviour in online spaces, such as sharing articles, are ultimately the proxies used by online platforms to determine which types of content to promote or restrict, and irresponsible behaviour like sharing articles before reading their contents will skew the online experience for not only the consumers themselves, but also for others who use the platform. This might lead to the spreading of both disinformation and misinformation, not only to their own followers or friends, but with the effects also potentially rippling down to a larger group of users, as the shared article might be interpreted to be 'good' by the algorithm and shared to others outside the individual's social circle. We feel that it does not matter what the topic of the article is, but that it is particularly important to be careful when sharing political articles since fake news tends to thrive in this area, since it often incites very emotional and potentially harmful reactions, and might also have severe impacts on global events, such as elections.\n",
    "\n",
    "One caveat to this is that we cannot expect everyone to be media literate, since not everyone has access to resources on digital or media literacy. Thus, it may be argued that this standard of responsibility should not be applied to all consumers utilising online platforms. However, instead of weakening individuals' responsibility for exercising, we feel that this strengthens the need for consumers who are indeed digitally literate, and thus should know better, to be even more responsible in being on guard against fake news, such as by reading articles in full before sharing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We have a few suggestions, as follows: <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Personal Solutions** \n",
    "- As discussed above, consumers should be aware of potential signs of fake news to look out for, and should be mindful of their online behaviours, like deciding on what to share.\n",
    "- Consumers should carry out fact checking before sharing or engaging meaningfully with articles.\n",
    "- Consumers should check the sources of articles and news before sharing them. Creators should also cite their sources.\n",
    "- Awareness programs to share about digital literacy skills should be set up, and individuals should also play a role in educating their friends and family members who might not have these skills, like older family members who are not used to using ionline platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technological Solutions** <br>\n",
    "Our group has thought of a few solutions which utilise technology to combat the propagation of disinformation. In all these solutions, we would like to emphasise the importance of human involvement - we believe that even when technology is used, humans should always be involved in the implementation of these solutions, as we feel that at this point, humans are ultimately better able to screen for disinformation than machines, since they are aware of cultural and political contexts which purely technological tools might miss out on in their screening. This also adds transparency and explanability to decisions made by online platforms, which we feel is desirable and more fair. We do recognise that humans are also fallible, since humans have political biases which might cause them to flag some types of news as fake news more than other types of news, but we feel that at this point, humans are still the best solution. We would also like to propose that perhaps a group of diverse human moderators could be used to hopefully average out biases and mitigate this.\n",
    "- A sentiment analyser could be used to screen if articles or other forms of content contain or aim to incite extreme emotions, which would have negative effects on consumers and are a flag for potential disinformation. Content which does not pass this initial screening should be put on hold and passed to human moderators, who check\n",
    "- Likes and dislikes can be one form users can use to indicate whether an article/form of content is 'good' or not, and might be an indicator of whether the content incites emotional responses, which is common in posts used in disinformation campaigns. Tools can hence be used to flag content which is heavily liked or disliked, which should raise suspicion, and these forms of content could be temporarily restricted. Human moderators should check these articles and other forms of content before choosing to delete them or lift the  restrictions.\n",
    "    - On this note, taking inspiration from Kaggle's implementation of tracking upvotes, other metrics like the rate and consistency of likes/dislikes could be tracked, as sudden bursts of likes or dislikes might indicate collusion, or concerted efforts to boost or dampen the spread of articles, which might indicate that a disinformation campaign is under way.\n",
    "- Information on the likes and dislikes certain posts/articles/other forms of content receive should be made transparent to consumers, such as by having an optional panel consumers can open to view more information on the engagement posts have received. This includes not only the number of likes and dislikes but also other information about the engagement posts receive, particularly the ratio of likes to dislikes and the time taken to like/dislike a video. This is as very quick likes and dislikes are suspicious, and this additional information might help consumers to deduce whether the likes/dislikes were organic or not, and thus make a decision on what they think of the quality of information in the content.\n",
    "- Companies should punish people who share disinformation, such as by banning accounts which spread disinformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We are also responsible. Not everyone can detect but those who can detect should be more responsible. Education campaigns important."
