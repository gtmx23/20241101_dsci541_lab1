In the lab, there might be questions on specifics from the required readings whereas the optional readings are more of a general help and for your own interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lec 1** Renee DiResta [\"How do we know what's true anymore\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIkJoUeoY-o)\n",
    "- **Lec 2 (partly)** Rachel Thomas [\"Disinformation\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFjk79ykWZk&t=1971s) (32:51 - 1:26:00)\n",
    "- [PBS Facebook documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg4XW4c9AAc) (1 h video. [Link if you're in the US](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA4qxPbpQE))\n",
    "- [A framework for ethical decision making](https://www.brown.edu/academics/science-and-technology-studies/framework-making-ethical-decisions) (15 min read, skip the entire section \"2. Traditional arrangement of the field of ethics\")\n",
    "- Rachel Thomas [\"The Problem with Metrics\"](https://www.fast.ai/2019/09/24/metrics/) (10 min read. There is also [a video on the same topic](https://youtu.be/US42H1znvKU?t=39), but this is more similar to what we covered in class already)\n",
    "- Guillaume Chaslot  [\"How Algorithms Can Learn to Discredit 'the Media'\"](https://guillaumechaslot.medium.com/how-algorithms-can-learn-to-discredit-the-media-d1360157c4fa)(5 min read.

I am giving a brief background to each so you can pick the ones that peak your interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rachel Thomas [\"Disinformation\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFjk79ykWZk&t=867s) (14:27 - 32:51).\n",
    "    - This is similar to Renee DiResta's talk we watch the first lecture, but goes through additional examples including a bit more on bias which we will talk about in later weeks.\n",
    "- Will Oremus [\"The Simplest Way to Spot Coronavirus Misinformation on Social Media\"](https://onezero.medium.com/the-simplest-way-to-spot-coronavirus-misinformation-on-social-media-4b7995448071)\n",
    "    - [Will Oremus](https://medium.com/@WillOremus) is a writer on digital literacy at Medium. This post covers how COVID mis & disinformation has been spread on social media and summarizes a few resources for steps you can take to quickly assess if something is likely true or not.\n",
    "- Rachelle Hampton [\"The Black Feminists Who Saw the Alt-Right Threat Coming\"](https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/black-feminists-alt-right-twitter-gamergate.html)\n",
    "    - [Rachelle Hampton](https://muckrack.com/rachelle-hampton) is a culture writer and reporter at Slate. This post covers how fake twitter accounts were put up in an attempt to stir up negative emotions around the black feminist community on Twitter and the real world consequences that followed. It also goes into how such behavior has been observed in other similar instances and the sources it sprung from.\n",
    "- This last one will not be accessible to all so its official classification is \"very optional\", but if you have access to watch Black Mirror (e.g. on Netflix), I recommend the episode \"The Waldo Moment\". It posits truth against popularity in a local election and shows how spreading disinformation can gain people's support when there is a lack of critical thinking and general fatigue with the current status. The instigator is a savage digital teddybear running for office which as you can hear already makes for a worthwhile watch.\n",

    "<details><summary>Click to show</summary>\n",
    "Since we don't have time to cover this much in class, I put together some resources on deepfakes. As these are becoming rather prevalent, I urge you to watch at least the first video here (~8 min) for you own digital health. A general disclaimer about the other content below is that some of it can be a bit uncanny with a slight dystopian vibe to it, so view at your own discretion (I think it is better to include this type of content as optional and let you decide what to watch, so that you can be aware of it and its individual/societal impact rather than that I don't mention it at all)\n",
    "\n",
    "- [This is a good introduction to deepfakes anchored in a current event from a few weeks ago.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70l8LzBpGWs)\n",
    "    - A couple of other great quality deepfakes are [this now classic obama interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ54GDm1eL0), this [parody roundtable discussion with celebrities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_6Tumd8EQI) (disclaimer: sometimes not so appropriate jokes), this [paper review of how to deepfake voices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQgYPv8tb6A), and this [brief report including how to detect deepfakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YpoYvhVmDw) (there are many more deepfakes videos out there).\n",
    "- The input required to make simpler deepfakes is often just a single photo. This is leveraged by MyHeritage, a company for building family trees online that now offers to [animate photos of your deceased relatives through their Deep Nostaliga algorithm](https://www.myheritage.com/deep-nostalgia). Creepy and uncanny? Or just the future you have been waiting for since the first time you read Harry Potter?\n",
    "    - [Emotional video on people watching their relatives \"brought back to life\" with Deep Nostalgia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqMJm4Gdus0) (viewer discretion advised, included to illustrate just how impactful these services can be and how sophisticated technology can integrate with and speak to what we might think of as very \"human\" emotions).\n",
    "    -  I recommend watching the black mirror episode \"Be right back\" for an extension of this concept to three dimensions.\n",
    "    - [I really recommend the (publicly available) short story \"Thoughts and prayers\"](https://slate.com/technology/2019/01/thoughts-and-prayers-ken-liu-short-story.html) from Ken Liu on what goes wrong when a family agrees to create a digital reanimation of their daughter to raise awareness of the mass-shooting that caused her death (if you like this one, check out his books \"The paper menagerie and other short stories\" and \"The hidden girl and other short stories\").\n",

    "1. The difference between misinformation and disinformation is that misinformation is simply false information, and may not necessarily be targeted or have a negative intention, such as an intent to cause harm. On the other hand, disinformation is often targeted at another group, and is intended to mislead audiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. While disinformation campaigns can take various forms, one general goal is to often cause confusion and tension in the general public, sometimes even a targeted population or community. This is often achieved by creating divisions by amplifying divisive issues, undermining trust by spreading misleading information or by trying to manipulate public opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Online echo chamber refers to a situation in which individuals (or groups) engage in conversations and share perspectives that amplify their personal beliefs, while excluding marginalized or opposing viewpoints. This is often facilitated by social media, whose algorithm is intended to help engage with like-minded individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Deepfakes are artificial media that is created using deep learning techniques, to manipulate or replace existing content. These medias, created by generative models are often so well created that it is almost impossible to distinguish a deepfake from a real media. Due to this reason, deepfakes are very harmful to exist on the free internet. GPTs are a series of language transformer models. Each version of GPT is trained to generate human-like text based on the input it receives.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. This statement refers to the idea that in this era of social media and fact-paced, engaging content,the popularity of information can influence its perceived truthfulness. In other words, the sheer amount of likes, shares and comments can create an illusion of credibility, even if the information itself is misleading.\n",

The goal of lab discussions are not to provide you with the right answers, but to help your discussion along. Your TA will assist in this by bringing up topics that you might not have thought of, ask questions to break the silence or a dead end, and move the conversation along so that you have time to go through most questions.

    "- Commit to learning, not \"winning\" debates. \n",
    "- Comment in order to share information and develop arguments further, not to persuade.\n",
    "- Listen respectfully, without interrupting, to try to understand each others' views.\n",
    "    - Don't focus on what you are going to say next while someone else is talking.\n",
    "- Challenge ideas, not individuals.\n",
    "    - And be open to having your own ideas challenged.\n",
    "- Think about as good arguments as possible against your position.\n",
    "    - This is especially useful if many of your peers have the same opinion, help your group find angles that you might otherwise be missing.\n",
    "- Allow everyone the chance to speak.\n",
    "    - Politely ask members of your group about their opinion.\n",
    "- Avoid assumptions about any member of the class or generalizations about social groups.\n",
    "    - Be careful about asking individuals to speak on the behalf of their (perceived) social group.\n",
    "- Be aware of [logical fallacies](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/common-logical-fallacies), but avoid pointing them out in rude or disrespectful ways."
